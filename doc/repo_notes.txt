Nexus 2 comes with built in mirroring for maven central. The only setup there is to go to the repository config for the proxy repos and enable the "Download remote indexes" option.

We need to add the various other repositories used in the build.

These are the repos that had to be added. They are all added as proxy Maven2 repos. Then they get added to the Public Repostories group.

Name: EPICS Maven Repo

----- P2 repos

The P2 support needs to be added as plugins. Two plugins were used:
Nexus P2 Bridge Plugin and the Nexus P2 Repository Plugin

- Search on maven central for these
- download bundle.zip of the version matching your nexus install
- unzip the bundle.zip into sonatype-work/nexus/plugin-repository
- restart the repo manager

Increase wrapper.java.maxmemory to a minimum of 2048. This configuration value can be found in $NEXUS_HOME/bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf.
